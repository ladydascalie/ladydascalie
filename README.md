### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer working on everything from high throughput APIs to command line tools.

Involved in free and open source software community, I create and maintain software, and I co-organise the [Golang Dorset](https://www.meetup.com/Golang-Dorset/) monthly meet-up alongside friends & colleagues.

My main workhorse is Go, which I use daily to work on both micro-services, as well as numerous command-line tools. I have extensive experience with PHP, both in creating new applications and maintaining legacy software.

In my spare time, I like engaging with educational material, writing small video games, mainly using C or Go & the SDL2 library and writing and recording music.
